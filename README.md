Live code the Internet of Things

> A [Bespoke.js](http://markdalgleish.com/projects/bespoke.js) presentation, built with [generator-bespoke](https://github.com/markdalgleish/generator-bespoke)

Abstract
--------

What can you build in 30 minutes, on stage, with a Tessel, a couple of Arduinos, some sensors and actuators? Is the IoT within reach? Can you do that yourself in the hackerspace this afternoon? In this talk I will demo all the relevant technologies for building an IoT prototype: the MQTT protocol, the Mosca broker, and how to use it from real hardware. Bonus points: I will also show how to connect a BLE device from node!
